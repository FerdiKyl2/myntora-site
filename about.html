    <h2>What is Myntora?</h2>
    <p>Myntora is an independent creative studio that designs immersive escape room games, mystery puzzles, and interactive digital experiences. Each product is crafted with precision, passion, and a love for storytelling.</p>

    <h2>What is Myntora Not?</h2>
    <p>Myntora is not a template store. We don’t recycle content. Each game, document, and puzzle is thoughtfully written and uniquely designed—no AI shortcuts, no generic mysteries.</p>

    <h2>Who is Behind Myntora?</h2>
    <p>Myntora was founded by <strong>Morgan</strong> in early 2025. As a creative force behind every product, Morgan combines narrative design, visual storytelling, and gameplay mechanics to build experiences worth remembering.</p>

    <h2>When Was It Founded?</h2>
    <p>Myntora officially launched in May 2025 with its first series of mystery games on Etsy. Since then, the brand has grown to include dozens of custom-made escape room games and immersive storytelling experiences.</p>

    <h2>Why Myntora?</h2>
    <p>Because every player deserves more than just a game—they deserve a mystery that makes them think, feel, and remember. Myntora stands for quality, emotion, and originality. We make games that stay with you.</p>
